# woodchuck
Contains a Python program to search for 'woodchuck' animals, and the datasets I used.
Essentially it uses files of nouns, and verbs to search through a file of animal names
in order to find animal names containing a noun + verb combination.

Contains a code snippet to produce a progress bar in the terminal as the program runs,
